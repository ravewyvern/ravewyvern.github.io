Correction to My Name in Class (please read before 3-14 class)

Dear Professor Laris,

I wanted to reach out to let you know that my preferred name in the system was previously listed as “katelyn,” but I have now removed this name so that my correct and legal name, Ian Hall, is displayed. I have updated this in my student records, and I wanted to ensure that your class roster reflects this change.

Additionally, moving forward, I would appreciate it if you could use Ian in class instead of katelyn to avoid any confusion.

My mother, Jennifer Powers, will also be reaching out to follow up on this to make sure everything is updated correctly.

Thanks,
Ian Hall
